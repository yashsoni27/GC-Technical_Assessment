# Developer Technical Assessment 

The following technical assessment will help us to understand your suitability for the position and will be used as part of the overall assessment including the interview.

- **Method of submission:** Your completed solution should be provided to us via a link to your repository that we can access.
- **Deadline:** Submit your completed solution to us by the end of **TBC**. 

## Instructions 

Create an [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) application using the latest version of .NET

Using the project templates and the sample data provided in the [solution](https://dev.azure.com/ukgc-assessment/_git/Licensee%20Records), create a simple web application to manage gambling licensee records. 

The solution includes ‘**Accounts.json**’ and ‘**Products.json**’ sample data on which to implement a backend and frontend. Persist changes to the JSON files only - avoid using a database for your solution. 

The solution should implement the following functionality: 

- Utilise a Web API backend to create, read, update and delete licensee account and product  records.
- Enable adding and editing of licensee account records.
- Enable adding and removing of licensed products on a licensee account provided in the product records list. 

Your solution should allow anonymous access - you do not need to worry about authentication.

Your solution should be built according to SOLID principles - you are free to augment the solution with any development patterns and best practices you would expect to see, if any.
